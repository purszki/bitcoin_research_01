Light Client Block Query

The current state for bitcoin light clients is to use compact block filters (BIP-158). A good blog to understand them intuitively exists here. At the time of writing, the disk space required for the index is 12GB, which results in reasonable bandwidth tradeoffs for high privacy; however, one downside is each filter has unique keys for hashing. This creates a CPU bottleneck for clients, limiting the effectiveness of this protocol on mobile devices.
Research Questions

    Does there exist a compact sketch that does not require (as much) hashing with a sketch size? Note the unique keys are required so attackers cannot maliciously construct scripts.
    Is there a deterministic data structure that would also be compact, but does not require hashes at all?
    Can we do better by querying a range of blocks?

This is an open-ended project, but regardless of the approach, you will likely find the bitcoinkernel bindings useful.
